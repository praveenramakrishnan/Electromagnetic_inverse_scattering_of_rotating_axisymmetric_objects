\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mario_clemente.png}}]{Mario Rene Clemente Vargas} 
received the B.Sc. degree in Electronic Engineering from the National 
University of Engineering (Peru) in 2002 and M.Sc degree from the University of
Genoa (Italy) in 2014. He is a Ph.D. student at the
Department of Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications Engineering, 
and Naval Architecture of the University of Genoa. He worked as technical
support in the field of telecommunications. Currently, he is working 
at the Applied Electromagnetics Laboratory of the Department of 
Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications Engineering, and Naval 
Architecture (DITEN) of the University of Genoa. 
His main research activities focus on the field of high-capacity
transmission lines for microwave circuits and photobiomodulation therapy.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mirco_raffetto.png}}]{Mirco Raffetto}  
was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1967. He received the “laurea” degree in 
Electronic Engineering (“summa cum laude”) from the University of Genoa 
in 1990, and the Ph. D. degree in “Models, Methods and Tools for Electronic and
Electromagnetic Systems” from the same university in 1997. 
After a four-year period spent in a telecommunications company, in 1994 he 
joined the Applied Electromagnetic Group, University of Genoa, where, 
at present, he is a Full Professor of Electromagnetic Fields at the 
Department of Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications Engineering, 
and Naval Architecture. Since 2016 he is the coordinator of the bachelor 
of science course in Electronic Engineering and Information Technology. 
His main research interests are in electromagnetic theory, 
electromagnetic scattering and computational electromagnetics. In
2006, he was the recipient of the Emerald Literati Network outstanding paper
award
